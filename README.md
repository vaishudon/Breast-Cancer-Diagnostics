# Breast Cancer Diagnostics (CSE 143 Project)

## **How to Run**
In order to run BCDn, you will need a variety of python libraries for the machine learning and data retrieval. Imports include… 
* Seaborn
* Gsspread
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* Pickle

You can use the pip install function to install these libraries:
```
pip install seaborn
pip install gspread oauth2client df2gspread
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pickle
```
After uploading all the files into the chosen IDE, running the main app.py file will provide a link to the web-application, which can then be opened on a web browser. 


## **BCDn.ipynb**
The BCDn.ipynb file is a notebook to show how the model was built, chosen, and how the data was preprocessed. This file is not necessary for running the actual application. The BCN.py file however is necessary for running the web app. Wherever you choose to run this, you must have the JSON file in the same folder as the BCN.py file otherwise it will throw an error because the file is accessed in the .py file.
